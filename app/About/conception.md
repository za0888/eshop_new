??????????
Stock is a child of User/manager (see relations in the models

we have  stock   case Main = 'main';
                   case Order = 'order';
                 ???  case Transport = 'transport';
and each manager is a stock( after button send has been
 pressed by manager one become responsible for the product)
 So we have 2 basic stock plus number of stocks equal to nember
  of sail managers
  models Stock and User related as one to one
  Stock Product ont to many

----------------
one start page for guest
another for managers
--------------
enum OrderStatus: string
{
    case Paid= 'paid';// product mark as deleted  from stock main
    case Pending = 'pending';//stock maim
    case Processing = 'processing';//came to stock manager
    case Shipped = 'shipped';//remains in the stock manager
    case Canceled = 'canceled';//get back to the stock main
}
