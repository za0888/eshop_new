Let us understand the steps in creating a Shell Script:

    Create a file using a vi editor(or any other editor). Name script file with extension .sh.
    Start the script with #! /bin/sh.
    Write some code.
    Save the script file as filename.sh.
    For executing the script type bash filename.sh.
